## Summary

<description>A load testing server</end> - v<version>0.5.0</end>

## Features

* Basic WebUI
* A new session (new set of cookies) is made per sequence
* Control sequence concurrency with `connections`
* Control test duration with `duration`
* Control number of runs with `runs`
* Set custom `headers`
* Create a set of `baseUrls`, randomly choosing a `baseUrl` to test against
* Create a set of `forms`, randomly choosing a `form` to POST with
* Create response expectations based on status code and body contents

## Future

* Nice WebUI **(Pull Request Anyone?)**
  * Dynamic Angular Form to construct a `Job` object
  * Nice display of results object
* Cancel jobs
* Modify result object to mirror the `Request` object 

## Install
```
$ npm install -g load-tester
```

## Run
```
$ load-tester <port>
Listening on <port>
```

Now, you'll find a basic webui at `http://localhost:<port>`

or you can try the live demo:

## Demo

http://node-load-tester.herokuapp.com

*Note: free heroku instances have bandwidth caps* 

## Basic Example

We'll target `http://echo.jpillora.com`, run the following sequence:
 * GET `/` (home) and expect a `200`
 * Then POST `/api/login` with creds and expect a `200`
 * Then confirm that we just logged in (`/test/user` and check it's `200`)
 * Then we'll logout
 * Finally we'll confirm that we just logged out (`/test/user` and check it's **`404`**)

<showFile("example/basic.json")>
``` json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://echo.jpillora.com",
  "duration": 5000,
  "connections": 1,
  "sequence": [
    { "method": "GET",  "path": "/" },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/api/login",  "form":{"username":"foo","password":"bar"} },
    { "method": "GET",  "path": "/test/user" },
    { "method": "GET",  "path": "/logout" },
    { "method": "GET",  "path": "/test/user", "expect": { "code": 404 } }
  ]
}
```
</end>

Since `http://echo.jpillora.com` is just an echo server, it didn't actually login,
so the second `/test/user` still responded with 200, which is seen as a failure:

``` json
{
  "paths": {
    "GET /": {
      "pass": 2,
      "fail": 0,
      "total": 2,
      "avgResponseTime": 877
    },
    "POST /api/login": {
      "pass": 2,
      "fail": 0,
      "total": 2,
      "avgResponseTime": 936
    },
    "GET /test/user": {
      "pass": 2,
      "fail": 2,
      "total": 4,
      "avgResponseTime": 692
    },
    "GET /logout": {
      "pass": 2,
      "fail": 0,
      "total": 2,
      "avgResponseTime": 660
    }
  },
  "errors": {
    "expected code: 404 got: 200 (for GET /test/user)": 2
  },
  "pass": 8,
  "fail": 2,
  "total": 10,
  "totalTime": 7719,
  "avgResponseTime": 791
}
```

## API

`POST /job`

Create a load test `Job`

### `Job` Object Properties

* `baseUrl` (String) - Target URL
* `baseUrls` (Array[String]) - Target URLs
* `headers` (Object) - Header/Value pairs to apply to all `Request`s
* `runs` (Number) - Number of times to run through the `sequence`
* `duration` (Number) - Keep running through the `sequence` for `duration`ms
* `connections` (Number) - Number of HTTP clients (each will run through the `sequence`)
* `sequence` (Array[`Request`]) - The sequence of `Request`s to execute (a new cookie jar is created per sequence)

### `Request` Object Properties

* `method` (String) - HTTP Method to use (default:`"GET"`)
* `path` (String) - URL Path to be appended to `baseUrl`
* `headers` (Object) - Header/Value pairs to apply to this `Request` (overrides `Job` `headers`)
* `form` (Object) - Object to application/form encode
* `forms` (Array[Object]) - Round-robin through objects to application/form encode
* `json` (Object) - Object to be sent through as JSON
* `expect` (Object) - Expectation definition object
    * `code` (Number) - Expect a particular HTTP status code **(default:200)**
    * `contains` (String) - Expect the HTTP body to contain
    * `match` (String) - Expect the HTTP body to match `new RegExp(match)`
  
**Note:** There must be **one** `expect`ation

**Note:** Failed expections are accumulated in the results, e.g:
``` json
"errors": {
  "expected code: 404 got: 200 (for GET /test/user)": 2
}
```

## More Examples

#### Random form data

<showFile("example/random-forms.json")>
``` json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://echo.jpillora.com",
  "duration": 5000,
  "connections": 1,
  "sequence": [
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/api/login",  "forms":[
        {"username":"foo","password":"bar"},
        {"username":"ping","password":"pong"},
        {"username":"zap","password":"zoop"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</end>

#### More response expectations

<showFile("example/expectations.json")>
``` json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://echo.jpillora.com",
  "runs": 3,
  "connections": 1,
  "sequence": [
    { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/code-test",  "expect": { "code": 408 } },
    { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/string-test",  "expect": { "contains": "abc" } },
    { "method": "GET", "path": "/api/regex-test",  "expect": { "match": "^a[Bb]c$" } }
  ]
}
```
</end>

*`runs` is how many times to run the sequence. Can be used with or instead of `duration`.*


#### Simulate load balancer

*Every request will round-robin through the `baseUrls`*

*Requests may also specify a `header` object which will override the job's `header` object*

<showFile("example/load-balancer.json")>
``` json
{
  "baseUrls": [
    "http://74.125.237.114",
    "http://74.125.237.115",
    "http://74.125.237.116"
  ],
  "headers": {
    "host": "www.google.com.au"
  },
  "duration": 5000,
  "connections": 1,
  "sequence": [
    { "path": "/" }
  ]
}
```
